 @discussion Use this method to send data to all players in a match. If you do not need to send data to all players, instead use the alternate method which lets you specify players. 
 
 Send messages at the lowest frequency that allows your game to function well. Your game’s graphics engine may be running at 30 to 60 frames per second, but your networking code can send updates much less frequently.
 
 Use the smallest message format that gets the job done. Messages that are sent frequently or messages that must be received quickly by other participants should be carefully scrutinized to ensure that no unnecessary data is being sent.
 
 Pack your data into the smallest representation you can without losing valuable information. For example, an integer in your program may use 32 or 64 bits to store its data. If the value stored in the integer is always in the range 1 through 10, you can store it in your network message in only 4 bits.
 
 Send messages only to the participants that need the information contained in the message. For example, if your game has two different teams, team-related messages should be sent only to the members of the same team. Sending data to all participants in the match uses up networking bandwidth for little gain.
 
 @param data The data to be sent to all of the players. This should not exceed 1000 bytes for quick sending, and should not exceed 87 kilobytes when sending reliably.
 @param sendQuickly Specify YES if the data should be sent without ensuring delivery (faster). NO if the data's delivery should be garunteed (slower).
 @param handler Implement the completion handler to recieve information about the status of the data send. The error parameter may be nil if there was no error. */
